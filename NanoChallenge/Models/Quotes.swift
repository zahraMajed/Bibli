//MARK: concept explaination
//Hashable is "a type that provides an integer hash value‚Äù. A hashValue is an integer that is the same for any two instances that compare equally.
//Codable is a type that can convert itself into and out of an external representation. it's alias for two other protocols: Encodable and Decodable
//Encode: Convert from swift to other representation such as JSON.
//Decode: Convert from external representation such as JSON to swift.
//If your property names match your JSON field names, and your properties are all Codable, then you can convert to or from JSON very easily.
